Getting tired of typing a million commands to move a few folders?

Try chaining together locations to move faster. For example, cd ../../../Buffer_Beginner_Trail from here at the top of the mountain will get you all the way into the Buffer_Beginner_Trail folder.  Make sure to put the "/" in between each of the locations.
